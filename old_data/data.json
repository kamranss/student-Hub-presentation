  "executiveSummary": "Universities struggle to maintain accurate, long-term visibility into student and alumni outcomes because data is fragmented across CRMs, spreadsheets, surveys, and external platforms. StudentHub is a unified, university-owned platform that centralizes profiles, opportunities, engagement, and anonymized AI assistance so it stays relevant after graduation. Role-based dashboards personalize jobs, events, news, and mentorship for students, give employers structured applicant insights, and provide administrators with real-time engagement and system health visibility. Clean, centralized data improves match relevance, dashboards, and trust via privacy-first AI. The impact is a sustainable ecosystem that boosts employability, alumni relationships, and transparent pathways between students, employers, and the university.",
  "problemContext": {
    "overview": "Universities depend on accurate student and alumni data for jobs, mentorship, and engagement but current systems are fragmented and short-lived. Most platforms stop being relevant after graduation, so institutions lose visibility, alumni disengage, and employers lose access to verified talent.",
    "gap": "There is no unified, university-owned platform that remains relevant across the full career lifecycle. Fragmented data and one-time-use portals produce low engagement, weak tracking, and missed opportunities for mentorship and hiring.",
    "stakeholders": [
      {"role": "Students", "pain": "No personalized space that stays valuable after graduation; need tailored jobs, mentorships, events, news, and actionable profile insights."},
      {"role": "Alumni", "pain": "Want ongoing professional value and curated opportunities to mentor or give back but mostly receive generic outreach and drift away."},
      {"role": "Employers", "pain": "Struggle to find qualified talent in a structured way; career fairs and static boards do not surface best-fit candidates with match scores."},
      {"role": "Administrators", "pain": "Lack unified data, dashboards, and predictive insights for engagement, outcomes, or program planning."}
    ],
    "solutionAngle": "StudentHub becomes a lifetime professional hub that centralizes profiles, opportunities, events, news, mentorships, AI relevance tools, and analytics. Future phases add personal notes, task boards, and Canvas integration so the platform stays part of daily academic life."

    {"source": "CASE (2022)", "finding": "Structured engagement measurement outperforms manual tracking, supporting a centralized platform that unifies engagement, jobs, mentorships, and outcomes."},
    {"source": "Jones et al. (2017)", "finding": "Employment records are scattered across surveys, social media, and outdated CRMs, making clean datasets rare and validating consolidation of profiles, work histories, events, and interactions."},
    {"source": "AffinaQuest (2023); Bryant University (2018); Gomez-Cravioto et al. (2022)", "finding": "Predictive scoring works when data is organized; informs match modules for jobs, mentorship, and donations with transparent scores and explanations."},

    {"source": "Market gap", "finding": "Vendors like Graduway or AffinaQuest cover parts of engagement/advancement but do not deliver a unified student-alumni-employer ecosystem that stays relevant post-graduation."}
